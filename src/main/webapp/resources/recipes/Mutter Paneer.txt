Blanch the tomatoes in hot water, remove the skin and make puree out of it .
Cut the paneer into cubes and roast them with little ghee in a pan. When the paneer cubes turn light golden brown remove them from heat and set them aside in little warm water so that they stay soft and tender.
In the same pan in which you fried the paneer, add the paste from step 3 and sauté for 3 minutes.
Then add tomato puree, mix well and cook for 3 more minutes.
Now put chilly powder, turmeric powder, garam masala  powder, food color and butter. Mix the contents well.
