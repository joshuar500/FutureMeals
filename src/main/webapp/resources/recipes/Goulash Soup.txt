Ingredients

500 g lean beef
2 large onions
2 large potatoes, peeled
2 tbsp vegetable oil
3 tbsp powdered sweet paprika
1 tsp powdered hot paprika
1 tsp caraway seeds (not cumin)
1 tsp thyme (fresh or dried)
1 bay leaf
1 tsp marjoram (fresh or dried)
1/2 cup tomato puree
50 ml white vinegar
1 l beef stock or 2 stock cubes dissolved in 1 l of water.
black pepper
Procedure

Cut the beef and potatoes into 1.5 cm cubes. Cut the caraway seeds into rough chunks with a kitchen knife. Chop onions into thin slices. Warm the beef stock.
Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a cooking pan to medium/high heat. Fry the beef cubes until medium brown and crispy, remove and drain on a kitchen towel.
Turn to medium heat. Add another tbsp of vegetable oil and roast the caraway seeds for 1 min. Add the onions and turn to low heat. Gently roast the onions until they turn yellowish.
Add the beef cubes and roast for another 2 min. Slowly add the vinegar, beef stock, potatoes and tomato puree. Add the sweet paprika and stir well to disperse clumps.
Season with marjoram, thyme, hot paprika, the bay leaf and a pinch of black pepper. Simmer for 30 min.
Variations

Garnish each dish with a tbsp of sour cream or creme fraiche and sprinkle with freshly cut chives before serving.
Add 100 ml of red wine after frying beef/onions.
For a more nutritious meal, fry 2 green peppers, 3 tomatoes, 1 carrot and 1 leek (all chopped) with the onions.
